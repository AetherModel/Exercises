Write a C++ program that outputs the number 5.  Specifically, the program should look like:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << 5 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

It should be saved into a file called ex01a.cpp. You should then be able to compile this with the following command:

c++ -o ex01a.exe ex01a.cpp

You can then execute the program by typing:

./ex01a.exe

This should generate the following output:

5
